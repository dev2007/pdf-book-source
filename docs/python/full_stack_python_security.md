## 内容简介

**No-nonsense techniques, libraries, and best practices you can use to keep your Python applications safe and secure.**

In Full Stack Python Security: Cryptography, TLS, and attack resistance, you’ll learn how to:

- Use algorithms to encrypt, hash, and digitally sign data
- Create and install TLS certificates
- Implement authentication, authorization, OAuth 2.0, and form validation in Django
- Protect a web application with Content Security Policy
- Implement Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Protect against common attacks including clickjacking, denial of service attacks, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and more

*Full Stack Python Security: Cryptography, TLS, and attack resistance* teaches you everything you’ll need to build secure Python web applications. As you work through the insightful code snippets and engaging examples, you’ll put security standards, best practices, and more into action. Along the way, you’ll get exposure to important libraries and tools in the Python ecosystem.

**about the technology**

Security is a full-stack concern, encompassing user interfaces, APIs, web servers, network infrastructure, and everything in between. Master the powerful libraries, frameworks, and tools in the Python ecosystem and you can protect your systems top to bottom. Packed with realistic examples, lucid illustrations, and working code, this book shows you exactly how to secure Python-based web applications.
