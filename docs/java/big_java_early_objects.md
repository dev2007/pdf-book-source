## 内容简介

**DESCRIPTION**

***Big Java: Early Objects, 7th Edition*** focuses on the essentials of effective learning and is suitable for a two-semester introduction to programming sequence. This text requires no prior programming experience and only a modest amount of high school algebra. Objects and classes from the standard library are used where appropriate in early sections with coverage on object-oriented design starting in Chapter 8. This gradual approach allows students to use objects throughout their study of the core algorithmic topics, without teaching bad habits that must be un-learned later. The second half covers algorithms and data structures at a level suitable for beginning students.

**N**EW TO THIS EDITION**

**Interactive Learning:**

Interactive content is front and center, with immersive activities integrated with the text to foster in-depth learning. Students don’t just watch animations and code traces, they work on generating them right in the eText.

**Integrated Live Coding:**

Live code samples invite the reader to experiment and to learn programming constructs first hand. The activities provide instant feedback to show students what they did right and where they need to study more.

**Adapted to Java Versions 8 Through 11:**

This edition takes advantage of modern Java features where pedagogically sensible. A number of new methods and syntax are integrated as Special Topics throughout the eText.

**Detailed Topic Changes:**

Default, static, and private interface methods are introduced in a Special Topic.

Lambda expressions are optional for user interface callback.

The “diamond” syntax for generic classes is introduced as a Special Topic in Chapter 7 and used systematically in Chapter 15.

Local type inference with the var keyword is described in a Special Topic.

Useful features such as the try-with-resources statement are integrated into the eText.

Chapter 21 covers the utilities provided by the Paths and Files classes.
