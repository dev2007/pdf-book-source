## 内容简介

**Brief Java: Early Objects, 9th Edition** focuses on the essentials of effective learning and is suitable for a two-semester introduction to programming sequence. This text requires no prior programming experience and only a modest amount of high school algebra. Objects and classes from the standard library are used where appropriate in early sections with coverage on object-oriented design starting in Chapter 8. This gradual approach allows students to use objects throughout their study of the core algorithmic topics, without teaching bad habits that must be un-learned later.

Choosing the enhanced eText format allows students to develop their coding skills using targeted, progressive interactivities designed to integrate with the eText. All sections include built-in activities, open-ended review exercises, programming exercises, and projects to help students practice programming and build confidence. These activities go far beyond simplistic multiple-choice questions and animations. They have been designed to guide students along a learning path for mastering the complexities of programming. Students demonstrate comprehension of programming structures, then practice programming with simple steps in scaffolded settings, and finally write complete, automatically graded programs.

The perpetual access VitalSource Enhanced eText, when integrated with your school’s learning management system, provides the capability to monitor student progress in VitalSource SCORECenter and track grades for homework or participation.

- Enhanced eText and interactive functionality available through select vendors and may require LMS integration approval for SCORECenter.

**NEW TO THIS EDITION**

**Interactive Learning**: Interactive content is front and center, with immersive activities integrated with the text to foster in-depth learning. Students don’t just watch animations and code traces, they work on generating them right in the eText.

**Integrated Live Coding**: Live code samples invite the reader to experiment and to learn programming constructs first hand. The activities provide instant feedback to show students what they did right and where they need to study more.

**Adapted to Java Versions 8 Through 11**: This edition takes advantage of modern Java features where pedagogically sensible. A number of new methods and syntax are integrated as Special Topics throughout the eText.

**Detailed Topic Changes**: Default, static, and private interface methods are introduced in a Special Topic.Lambda expressions are optional for user interface callback.The “diamond” syntax for generic classes is introduced as a Special Topic in Chapter 7 and used systematically in Chapter 15. Local type inference with the var keyword is described in a Special Topic.Useful features such as the try-with-resources statement are integrated into the eText.
