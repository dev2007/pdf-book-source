## 内容简介

Testing Java Microservices teaches you to implement unit and integration tests for microservice systems running on the JVM. You’ll work with a microservice environment built using Java EE, WildFly Swarm, and Docker. You’ll learn how to increase your test coverage and productivity, and gain confidence that your system will work as you expect.

**about the technology**

Microservice applications present special testing challenges. Even simple services need to handle unpredictable loads, and distributed message-based designs pose unique security and performance concerns. These challenges increase when you throw in asynchronous communication and containers.

**about the book**

Testing Java Microservices teaches you to implement unit and integration tests for microservice systems running on the JVM. You’ll work with a microservice environment built using Java EE, WildFly Swarm, and Docker. You’ll advance from writing simple unit tests for individual services to more-advanced practices like chaos or integration tests. As you move towards a continuous-delivery pipeline, you’ll also master live system testing using technologies like the Arquillian, Wiremock, and Mockito frameworks, along with techniques like contract testing and over-the-wire service virtualization. Master these microservice-specific practices and tools and you’ll greatly increase your test coverage and productivity, and gain confidence that your system will work as you expect.
