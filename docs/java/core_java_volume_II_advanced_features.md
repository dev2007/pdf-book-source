## 内容简介

**Description**

Core Java® has long been recognized as the leading, no-nonsense tutorial and reference for experienced programmers who want to write robust Java code for real-world applications. Now, Core Java®, Volume II–Advanced Features, Eleventh Edition, has been updated to reflect Java SE 9, 10, and 11.

Core Java, Vol. II covers advanced user-interface programming and the enterprise features of the Java SE platform. It carefully explains the most important language and library features and shows how to build real-world applications with thoroughly tested examples. The example programs have been carefully crafted to be easy to understand as well as useful in practice, so you can rely on them as the starting point for your own code. All of the code examples have been rewritten to reflect modern Java best practices and code style. The critical new features introduced with Java SE 9, 10, and 11 are all thoroughly explored with the depth and completeness that readers expect from this title.

**Features**

- Thorough explanation of how to use powerful new Project Jigsaw features
- Explains how to create, compile and write a modular jar
- Demonstrates how to use the new logging interface
- Updated chapter on how to use Inheritance and Interfaces effectively
- Introduction to the new Garbage Collector (G1GC)

**New to This Edition**

According to Brian Goetz, Oracle’s Java language architect, the long awaited, modularization of the Java SE Platform and the JDK is the biggest change ever for Java. These changes ripple through the eleventh edition, which includes complete coverage of the new modularization features introduced in Java SE 9 as well as other new features, including JShell, a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for Java that allows developers to evaluate code snippets (declarations, statements, expressions) so they can test the code as they create it.

**Other key features covered include**:

- Process API updates
- Improved contended locking
- Unified JVM logging
- Compiler control enhancements
- Smart Java compilation
- HTML5 Javadoc
