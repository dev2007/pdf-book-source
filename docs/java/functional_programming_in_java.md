## 内容简介

**About the technology**

Here’s a bold statement: learn functional programming and you’ll be a better Java developer. Fortunately, you don’t have to master every aspect of FP to get a big payoff. If you take in a few core principles, you’ll see an immediate boost in the scalability, readability, and maintainability of your code. And did we mention that you’ll have fewer bugs? Let’s get started!

**About the book**

Functional Programming in Java teaches you how to incorporate the powerful benefits of functional programming into new and existing Java code. This book uses easy-to-grasp examples, exercises, and illustrations to teach core FP principles such as referential transparency, immutability, persistence, and laziness. Along the way, you’ll discover which of the new functionally inspired features of Java 8 will help you most.

**What’s inside**

Writing code that’s easier to read and reason about
Safer concurrent and parallel programming
Handling errors without exceptions
Java 8 features like lambdas, method references, and functional interfaces
About the reader

Written for Java developers with no previous FP experience.
