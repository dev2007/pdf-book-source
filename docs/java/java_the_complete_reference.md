## 内容简介

**The Definitive Java Programming Guide**

Fully updated for Java SE 17, Java™: The Complete Reference, 12th Edition explains how to develop, compile, debug, and run Java programs. Best-selling programming author Herb Schildt covers the entire Java language, including its syntax, keywords, and fundamental programming principles. You’ll also find information on key portions of the Java API library, such as I/O, the Collections Framework, the stream library, and the concurrency utilities.
