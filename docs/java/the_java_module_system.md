## 内容简介

Java’s much-awaited “Project Jigsaw” is finally here! Java 11 includes a built-in modularity framework, and The Java Module System is your guide to discovering it. In this new book, you’ll learn how the module system improves reliability and maintainability, and how it can be used to reduce tight coupling of system components.

**about the technology**

Packaging code into neat, well-defined units makes it easier to deliver safe and reliable applications. The Java Platform Module System is a language standard for creating these units. With modules, you can closely control how JARs interact and easily identify any missing dependencies at startup. This shift in design is so fundamental that starting with Java 9, all core Java APIs are distributed as modules, and libraries, frameworks, and applications will benefit from doing the same.

**about the book**

The Java Module System is your in-depth guide to creating and using Java modules. With detailed examples and easy-to-understand diagrams, you’ll learn the anatomy of a modular Java application. Along the way, you’ll master best practices for designing with modules, debugging your modular app, and deploying to production.
