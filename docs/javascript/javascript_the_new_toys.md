## 内容简介

**DESCRIPTION**

All of JavaScript’s newest features, in depth, made easy to understand.

JavaScript is a rapidly changing language and it can be challenging to keep up with all the new toys being added. JavaScript: The New Toys explores the newest features of the world’s most popular programming language while also showing readers how to track what’s coming next. After setting the stage by covering who manages the process of improving JavaScript, how new features get introduced, terminology, and a high-level overview of new features, it details each new or updated item in depth, with example uses, possible pitfalls, and expert recommendations for updating old habits in light of new features. JavaScript: The New Toys:

- Covers all the additions to JavaScript in ES2015-ES2019 plus a preview of ES2020 (and beyond)
- Explores the latest syntax: nullish coalescing, optional chaining, let and const, class syntax, private methods, private fields, new.target, numeric separators, BigInt, destructuring, default parameters, arrow functions, async functions, await, generator functions, … (rest and spread), template literals, binary and octal literals, ** (exponentiation), computed property/method names, for-of, for-await-of, shorthand properties, and others
- Details the new features and patterns including modules, promises, iteration, generators, Symbol, Proxy, reflection, typed arrays, Atomics, shared memory, WeakMap, WeakSet, and more
- Highlights common pitfalls and explains how to avoid them
- Shows how to follow the improvements process and even participate in the process yourself
- Explains how to use new features even before they’re widely supported

With its comprehensive coverage and friendly, accessible style, JavaScript: The New Toys provides an invaluable resource for programmers everywhere, whether they work in web development, Node.js, Electron, Windows Universal Apps, or another JavaScript environment.
