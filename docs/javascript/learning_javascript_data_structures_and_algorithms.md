## 内容简介

Create classic data structures and algorithms such as depth-first search and breadth-first search, learn recursion, as well as create and use a heap data structure using JavaScript

Learn

Declare, initialize, add, and remove items from arrays, stacks, and queues
Create and use linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists
Store unique elements with hash tables, dictionaries, and sets
Explore the use of binary trees and binary search trees
Sort data structures using algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort
Search elements in data structures using sequential sort and binary search

**About**

A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer to utilize resources efficiently. Data structures and algorithms are the base of every solution to any programming problem. With this book, you will learn to write complex and powerful code using the latest ES 2017 features.

Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms begins by covering the basics of JavaScript and introduces you to ECMAScript 2017, before gradually moving on to the most important data structures such as arrays, queues, stacks, and linked lists. You will gain in-depth knowledge of how hash tables and set data structures function as well as how trees and hash maps can be used to search files in an HD or represent a database. This book serves as a route to take you deeper into JavaScript. You’ll also get a greater understanding of why and how graphs, one of the most complex data structures, are largely used in GPS navigation systems in social networks.

Toward the end of the book, you’ll discover how all the theories presented in this book can be applied to solve real-world problems while working on your own computer networks and Facebook searches.

**Features**

- Implement common data structures and the associated algorithms along with the context in which they are used
- Master existing JavaScript data structures such as arrays, sets, and maps, and learn how to implement new ones such as stacks, linked lists, trees, and graphs in ES 8
- Develop abstract data types to make JavaScript a more flexible and powerful programming language
