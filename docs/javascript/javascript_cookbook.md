## 内容简介

Why reinvent the wheel every time you run into a problem with JavaScript? This cookbook is chock-full of code recipes for common programming tasks, along with techniques for building apps that work in any browser. You’ll get adaptable code samples that you can add to almost any project–and you’ll learn more about JavaScript in the process.

The recipes in this book take advantage of the latest features in ECMAScript 2020 and beyond and use modern JavaScript coding standards. You’ll learn how to:

- Set up a productive development environment with a code editor, linter, and test server
- Work with JavaScript data types, such as strings, arrays, and BigInts
- Improve your understanding of JavaScript functions, including arrow functions, closures, and generators
- Apply object-oriented programming concepts like classes and inheritance
- Work with rich media in JavaScript, including audio, video, and SVGs
- Manipulate HTML markup and CSS styles
- Use JavaScript anywhere with Node.js
- Access and manipulate remote data with REST, GraphQL, and Fetch
- Get started with the popular Express application-building framework
- Perform asynchronous operations with Promises, async/await, and web workers
