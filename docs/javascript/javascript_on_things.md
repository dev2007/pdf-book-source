## 内容简介

JavaScript on Things is your first step into the exciting and downright entertaining world of programming for small electronics. If you know enough JavaScript to hack a website together, you’ll be making things go bleep, blink, and spin faster than you can say “nodebot.”

**about the technology**

Are you ready to make things move? If you can build a web app, you can create robots, weather stations, and other funky gadgets! In this incredibly fun, project-based guide, JavaScript hardware hacker Lyza Danger Gardner takes you on an incredible journey from your first flashing LED through atmospheric sensors, motorized rovers, Bluetooth doorbells, and more. With JavaScript, some easy-to-get hardware, and a bit of creativity, you’ll be beeping, spinning, and glowing in no time.

**about the book**

JavaScript on Things introduces the exciting world of programming small electronics! You’ll start building things immediately, beginning with basic blinking on Arduino. This fully illustrated, hands-on book surveys JavaScript toolkits like Johnny-Five along with platforms including Raspberry Pi, Tessel, and BeagleBone. As you build project after interesting project, you’ll learn to wire in sensors, hook up motors, transmit data, and handle user input. So be warned: once you start, you won’t want to stop.
